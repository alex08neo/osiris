## User Experience

### Message Feedback
- [ ] Implement a dual auto-react mechanism (üëç and üëé) for Osiris' messages.
  - [ ] If a user selects one, store both that message and the message Osiris was responding to for analysis.
    - Note: This is useful for fine-tune training models.

### User Interaction Handling
- [ ] Hold discussions among contributors to decide:
  - [ ] Whether Osiris should "reply" to the message it's responding to.
  - [ ] How Osiris should handle "replies" to its own messages.
  
### Non-Interference with User Mentions
- [ ] Make Osiris not respond if a message contains a user mention (@) or is a reply to a non-bot message.

### Command Autocomplete
- [ ] Explore command autocomplete functionality, specifically for model selection.
  - [ ] Discuss with contributors about querying OpenAI at bot launch to get a list of chat completion models.

## Optimization and Scalability

### Database Optimization
- [ ] Implement a more robust database solution using PostgreSQL for storing conversation data.
  - [ ] Discuss with contributors about database options, keeping in mind that SQLite is not recommended.

### Multi-Server Support
- [ ] Optimize Osiris for usage across multiple Discord servers.

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Write unit tests for all Osiris commands.
  
### Integration Tests
- [ ] Set up integration tests to simulate end-to-end functionality (if possible)

### Multi-Server Load Testing
- [ ] Conduct load testing across multiple channels using another Osiris instance (or other GPT-enabled bot)
  - [ ] Aim to identify when rate limits become an issue.

---

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Use comprehensive inline comments for code documentation, explaining function purposes and parameter types.

### User Guide
- [ ] Develop a comprehensive user guide.

---

## Security

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement a robust rate-limiting mechanism to prevent abuse.
